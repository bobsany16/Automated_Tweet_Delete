# Automated_Tweet_Delete

# Problem

Twitter is great, but when a user has been using it since 2011, the tweets have the tendency to become "cringy." That's the case for me. I wanted to be able to delete all tweets dating back to 2011 but I absolutely do not want to sit around and manually delete 1000 something tweets. 

# Solution
Upon coming across a YouTube video regarding a Tinder bot, I thought I would try to make a Twitter bot that can delete the old tweets for me. 

# Progress
 + Part 1/n: The bot can automatically open up Twitter, then log in using my username and password. 
 + More to come.
 
# Looking Forward: 
-Finding the XPATH for the writing tweet section is such a hassle. => Would like to achieve this next time.
